<h2>about the Leaf</h2>
<p>The Oberlin Leaf was created to fill a
  perceived vacuum at Oberlin for publications that
pursue the ugly truth. </p>

  <p>We see that existing media corporations at
  Oberlin serve dark and ancient established interests,
  and we strive to disrupt this environment with
  furiously independent journalism. </p>

  <p>We’re dedicated to telling the other side of the story -
   the stories that have never been told, are not
   being told, and probably will never be
   told if we don’t tell them ourselves.</p>

   <p>We also publish fiction, poetry and visual art
     - see Stories and Tidbits.  </p>
